# MovieRecommendation
In this hustling world, entertainment is a
necessity for each one of us to refresh our mood
and energy. Entertainment regains our
confidence for work and we can work more
enthusiastically. For revitalizing ourselves, we
can listen to our preferred music or can watch
movies of our choice. For watching favourable
movies online, we can utilize movie
recommendation systems, which are more
reliable, since searching of preferred movies will
require more and more time which one cannot
afford to waste. In this paper, to improve the
quality of a movie recommendation system, an
approach of content-based filtering, and using
Support Vector Machine as a classifier and
genetic algorithm is presented in the proposed
methodology and comparative results have
been shown which depicts that the proposed
approach shows an improvement in the
accuracy, quality and scalability of the movie
recommendation system than the pure
approaches in three different datasets. This
approach helps to get the advantages from
content-based system and as well as tries to
eliminate the drawbacks of this methods. Movie
recommendation systems usually predict what
movies a user will like based on the attributes
present in previously liked movies. Such
recommendation systems are beneficial for
organizations that collect data from large
amounts of customers, and wish to effectively
provide the best suggestions possible. A lot of
factors can be considered while designing a
movie recommendation system like the genre of
the movie, actors present in it or even the
director of the movie. The systems can
recommend movies based on one or a
combination of two or more attributes.
