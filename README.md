# MovieRecommendation
Movie recommendation systems are becoming increasingly popular in the world of entertainment. One way to improve these systems is by using a technique called potstemming. Potstemming is a process that removes the common endings of words in order to group them together and improve the accuracy of the recommendations.
Streamlit is a powerful tool that can be used to create interactive web applications. It allows developers to easily create and deploy data-driven applications that can be accessed from anywhere.By combining potstemming and Streamlit, we can create a powerful movie recommendation system that provides accurate and personalized recommendations to users. This system can take into account a user's viewing history, ratings, and preferences to provide them with the most relevant movie recommendations.
